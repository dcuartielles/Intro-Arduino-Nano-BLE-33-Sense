# Build the project

## Build the templates

Prior to creating a course, you need to define the templates you will be using. The call for the template generation goes as follows:

`./create_templates.sh -d config -c config -f templates.csv`

and you have to call it inside the *build* folder. It will create a series of subfolders inside the *config* folder. First it will try to create *config* folder itself; this is done to allow testing the script. Next it will create a subfolder called *templates*. Inside that one, it will create a folder called *pages*, and inside that one, it will create one subfolder for each locale such as *en*, *es*, etc.

The different templates can be defined in the *CSV* file *templates.csv*. Creating a new template structure and thus a new site for a new translation is as easy as adding a new record to the file for each template design.

It is possible to create templates using all default parameters with `./create_templates.sh`

## Create the site's scaffolding

You will create a site by calling the *empty_site.sh* script as follows:

`./empty_site.sh -d config -c config -f templates.csv -l en`

which will create a series of subfolders inside the *config* folder. It will create a folder called *site*, with subfolder *pages*. Inside *pages* the system will create a folder for the locale, in the example *en*. That final folder will contain the *pages.csv* file which is the output of this script.

This file will contain the information about the default templates used in the header. The *header* is contained in the first three rows of the *CSV* file.

The default configuration considers *config* as default setting for destination and setup folders, *templates.csv* as the file to be generated, and *en* as the default locale. Therefore, calling `./empty_site.sh` with no parameters will have the same effect.

## Build the facade

Use the *populate_site.sh* script to add records to the *pages.csv* file automatically or manually (field by field). I recommend the semiautomatic mode by typing:

`./populate_site.sh -l en -c config -f pages.csv -m semiautomatic`

You will just get the question of how many records you want to add to the file and which is the template to use for each record.

Possible modes are: `automatic`, `semiautomatic` and `manual`

The fastest way to create a site with 10 pages would be:

`./populate_site.sh -n 10`

## Edit the pages file

You need to add your content to the *en/pages.csv* file. Make sure you include the properties needed for each type of content.

## Build the site

Once the templates have been created, render the markdown of the site by simply calling:

`./render_site.sh en .. config pages.csv`

inside the *build* folder. It will create all of the folders, *MD*, and code files based on templates. From there you will have the opportunity of modifying the content once more. Use the editor of your choice.

The parameters for the *render_site.sh* script are:

* locale: en, es, etc.
* name of the folder with templates and the like, typically *config*
* name of the *CSV* file containing the course

You will have to call it once per locale, which also means you should need the actual *CSV* file for the corresponding language.

## Note

* The *CSV* separator in use is the **Â¤** symbol in order to have commas within the text
* Current version of the code does not entertain the idea of localised code (but might happen)
