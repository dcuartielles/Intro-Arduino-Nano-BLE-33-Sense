# Build the project

Build the basic structure of the project by simply calling:

./create_folders.sh .. config exercises.csv

inside the *build* folder. It will create all of the folders, *MD*, and *INO* files based on templates. From there you will have to add your own content. Use the editor of your choice.

Note: the *CSV* separator in use is the **Â¤** symbol in order to have commas within the text
