# Who is this for?

The **Bash Site Generator** is for those interested in the creation of standalone database-free information systems, running on Linux machines. It accelerates the process of scaffolding your content by means of simple scripts, fed with content stored in spreadsheets.

Its structure is built on top of **templates**, which in turn are made of **information blocks**. The outcome of one script can be modified -by hand- prior to sending it to the following one. In the end you will have a site, organized in pages, listed in an index, including a navigation bar, which will be formatted in markdown, html, or the like.

You're welcome to **fork this project** and use it. It can be used to easily maintain courses in platforms like Github pages or equivalent.

If you don't run **Linux** and don't have **bash 4.0** or newer, this tool is not for you. If you don't like to play with **CLI**, this tool is not for you. If you are not familiar with **GIT**, this tool ... is not for you.
